To-Do app project

The point of this project for myself as a beginner, aside from getting my hands "dirty" via doing projects and not just relying on theory,
is to practice using webpack, modules, classes & OOP, problem solving from the handwritten steps all the way to code editor and try to write as clean code as I can.

What the aim of this project at this stage of my learning process is NOT: Creating a beautiful UI. That will wait another few months, because at the moment I am
learning JavaScript. When I finish, I will master HTML & CSS and corresponding best practices, preprocessor, framework, responsiveness, accessibility and on.
